                <h4>1. Concept and History</h4>
                <p className="para">
                  Necklaces have been worn as adornments for centuries, dating
                  back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks,
                  and Romans. Originally made from natural materials like bones,
                  shells, and stones, necklaces evolved into intricate pieces
                  crafted from precious metals and gemstones. Over time,
                  necklaces have been used not only as decorative accessories
                  but also as symbols of status, wealth, and cultural identity.

                <p className="para">
                  Necklaces hold a significant place in the world of jewelry due
                  to their ability to enhance an outfit and express personal
                  style. A well-chosen necklace can be a statement piece,
                  drawing attention and adding a touch of elegance. Diamond
                  necklaces, in particular, are prized for their brilliance and
                  timeless beauty, often marking special occasions such as
                  weddings, anniversaries, and celebrations.

                    Chains go with everything. A fine platinum chain in a choker
                    length will add just a touch of shine. If you're giving the
                    gift of a classic chain necklace, consider giving an 18-inch
                    sterling silver or 18k gold chain to add an element of
                    visual interest to your gift recipient's wardrobe.

              <ul style={{ listStyle: "initial" }} className="detail para">
                <li>
                  Cut: The perfection of a diamond's cut directly affects its
                  brilliance and sparkle. A well-cut diamond will reflect light
                  optimally, creating a dazzling effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Color: Diamond color is graded from D (completely colorless)
                  to Z (light yellow). Colorless diamonds (D-F) are considered
                  the rarest and most valuable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clarity: Diamond clarity is determined by the number and
                  location of inclusions or blemishes within the diamond.
                  Diamonds with high clarity (FL, IF) are very rare and highly
                  valued.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Carat: The weight of a diamond is measured in carats. One
                  carat equals 200 milligrams. Larger diamonds typically have
                  higher value, but other factors such as cut, color, and
                  clarity also impact the overall value.

                    chain easily characterised by a pattern of oval shaped links
                    which consist of a single vertical bar in the middle of each
                    link. Just like the Curb and Figaro chain the links are then
                    hammered and diamond cut to create a stunning flat linked
                    chain.

                    hammed disc shaped links which are twisted like a Rope
                    Chain. This allows light to catch a different angles along

              <h3>Care and Maintenance</h3>
              <div>
                <h4>1. Cleaning Diamond Necklace</h4>
                <h4>a. Use Warm Water and Mild Soap:</h4>
                <ul style={{ listStyle: "initial" }} className="detail para">
                  <li>
                    Use Warm Water and Mild Soap: Soak the necklace in a
                    solution of warm water and mild soap for about 15-20
                    minutes. Gently brush the diamonds and chain with a soft
                    toothbrush to remove any dirt or grime.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rinse Thoroughly: Rinse the necklace under lukewarm running
                    water to remove all soap residues. Dry it with a soft,
                    lint-free cloth.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>b. Avoid Harsh Chemicals:</h4>
                <ul style={{ listStyle: "initial" }} className="detail para">
                  <li>
                    Reason: Harsh chemicals like bleach, chlorine, and ammonia
                    can damage the diamonds and metal settings, causing
                    discoloration or weakening the structure.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How to Avoid: Use only mild soap and water for cleaning.
                    Remove your necklace before swimming in chlorinated pools or
                    using household cleaning products.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>2. Storage</h4>
                <ul style={{ listStyle: "initial" }} className="detail para">
                  <li>
                    Store Separately: To prevent scratches and tangling, store
                    each necklace in a separate compartment or a soft pouch.
                    Avoid mixing different types of jewelry in one container.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Avoid Direct Sunlight: Store your necklaces in a cool, dry
                    place away from direct sunlight. Prolonged exposure to
                    sunlight can affect the durability of some settings and
                    cause tarnishing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use a Jewelry Box: A jewelry box with individual
                    compartments and a soft lining is ideal for storing
                    necklaces. This helps maintain their shine and prevents
                    damage.
